\chapter{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE}
Conclusion
 We have implemented a neural network application for text line recognition which takes image containing as input and provides OCR text as output.

Future Scope

The accuracy of recognition can be improved by using more advance techniques and improved algorithms and can be used for enhancing the digitization of data.
